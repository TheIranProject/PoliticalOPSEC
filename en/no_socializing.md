# No Socializing

1. **Maintain Boundaries**: Do not confuse political activism with socializing. Government agents often infiltrate opposition groups by posing as activists to get closer to real activists. Their primary goal is to uncover your true identity or to coax you into revealing the identities of others.

2. **Beware of Manipulation**: Posing as a political activist and pretending to be in love with you is a very common tactic employed by government agents. Many political activists have fallen victim to this strategy. Remember that these agents may spend months or even years pretending to be activists, but their only objective is to discover your real identity. Regardless of how much time you have spent chatting with someone online or how compelling their political theories may be, they should never be fully trusted. Always keep your online activism completely separate from your real life.
