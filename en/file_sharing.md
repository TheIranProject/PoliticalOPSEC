# File Sharing:

### What?

1. **Always wipe the metadata off the files you want to share.** Search the internet for instructions on how to do this for the specific file format and your operating system.

2. **Avoid sharing pictures that you have taken yourself, even after wiping the metadata.** If it's very important, consider creating a new identity and then sharing the files with other users who can subsequently reshare them. Avoid associating these types of images/videos with yourself.

### Why?

1. **File metadata can contain important information** about the date and time of file creation/modification, and in the case of images, geolocation data.

2. **Even amateur OSINT analysts might be able to find the location of an image just by looking at it, without the metadata.** Using a new identity makes you appear as just a random passerby who took a picture. Associating that image with your main account and your entire activity gives authorities a clue to follow up on.

### Additional Suggestions:

- **Educate yourself on digital forensics:** Understanding how digital forensics works can help you better protect your identity and the information you share.
