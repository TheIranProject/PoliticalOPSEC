# Ego Trips Are Dangerous

1. **Keep Activism Private**: Unless you are trying to create a cell for real-world activism, never discuss your online activism with anyone in real life. Trying to impress others by bragging about your followers or how many people agree with your ideas is very dangerous.

2. **Focus on the Cause**: Remember that the goal of activism is to promote change, not to seek validation or recognition. Stay focused on your mission and avoid drawing attention to yourself or your online presence.

3. **Fighting for Your Honor is a Trap**: You don't need to talk about all of your struggles for freedom, that one time you got arrested, all the protests you attended, or your family's history of fighting the regime. People online may try to downplay your seriousness in fighting for the cause, but this could very well be a trap designed to extract valuable information that could lead to your real identity.
