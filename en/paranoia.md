## What?

0. **Paranoia:** You must be paranoid. You can never be too careful when it comes to your digital security.

1. **Start from Scratch with OPSEC in Mind.**  
   If you already have a Twitter account with thousands of followers, consider abandoning it. It is highly likely that you have been careless and inadvertently shared personal information, even if the account is anonymous. This could include using a personal email address or connecting the account to your personal phone number through two-factor authentication (2FA). Start fresh with OPSEC in mind; don’t take unnecessary risks.

2. **Don’t Share Any Information Unless Absolutely Necessary.**  
   For instance, if you are an ethnic activist, sharing your ethnicity may be essential. However, in most other cases, information that is not absolutely necessary for your activism should remain private. This includes details such as your country or city of residence, ethnicity, and even personal experiences. Be VERY careful with what you share online.

3. **Keep Everything Random.**  
   Never use the same usernames you have used before, and avoid creating usernames based on your real name. If you struggle to come up with something random, use a username generator to create a meaningless username.

4. **Apply the Same Principles to Non-Public Information.**  
   This includes your email address and any other identifiers that might not be publicly visible. Ensure that these do not connect back to your real identity or previous accounts, even if you *think* nobody is going to see them.

## Why?

1. **Narrowing Your Identity Pool.**  
   Consider a country with a population of 100 million people. Any information you disclose reduces the pool of individuals you could be identified as. For example, sharing your city of residence could narrow it down to a few million, your neighborhood even less, and your ethnicity further still.

2. **Intelligence Agencies Are Actively Monitoring.**  
   Intelligence agencies consist of individuals who spend significant time online, either searching for people like you, or just spending time monitoring anyone who is against the govenment. Even if your "safe" username does not exactly match any of your old usernames, agents/people who are cooperating with the government and have spent a lot of time online may still make connections. Don’t take unnecessary risks; choose a random username. You won’t lose anything by doing so.

3. **Data Leaks Can Expose Your Information.**  
   Any data leak can lead to your personal and "private" information becoming public. Your usernames should never have any connection to your real identity or your "past anonymous self." Remember, you may not have been as careful with your previous accounts. Avoid making any connections between your current accounts and your past accounts.
