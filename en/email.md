# Email and PGP

## What?

1. There are some relatively "safe" and privacy-friendly options out there, but you have to use **all of them** with caution. Never give any personal information to your email provider, and never send any important information in plain text. Learn to use PGP (Pretty Good Privacy). Do not send any important emails to anyone without using PGP.

2. The most reputable option for privacy-focused email is ProtonMail.

3. **Encrypt Locally or Using an Email Client:** Encrypt your emails locally using PGP tools (like GnuPG) or through a dedicated email client like Thunderbird. Avoid relying on web-based email applications for PGP encryption.

4. Combine the safe email provider with email aliases. There are services that you can use, such as ProtonPass, SimpleLogin, and addy.io.

## Why?

1. Many email providers, including well-known "privacy-focused" ones, have a history of cooperating with governments and handing out users' private information. These companies are required by law to cooperate with authorities, and many of them do so not out of malice, but because they have to. This means the responsibility for keeping your data and communications safe and private ultimately falls on you. Providers like ProtonMail offer options that can enhance your privacy. Even if your email address were to be compromised, you would still have options to keep everything secure. Using PGP significantly mitigates this risk; even if authorities gain access to your email history, they will not be able to decrypt your emails.

2. Email alias services create an alias and will forward any email sent to that alias to your main email address. This way, even if your account on a website is compromised, nobody will know your real email address.

## Additional Suggestions:

- **Be Wary of Phishing Attacks:** Educate yourself about common phishing tactics. Always verify the sender's email address and be cautious of links and attachments in emails.
