# Payment

## What:

1. **Avoid using your credit card for services whenever possible.** If the service offers payment by cryptocurrency, opt for that. If it doesn't, consider using another service that does. Many VPN and VoIP services accept cryptocurrency payments.

2. **Be aware that Bitcoin transactions can be easily tracked.** Monero is a safer option for maintaining privacy, but no amount of technological sophistication can protect a user from making mistakes. Educate yourself about cryptocurrencies and how they work before using them. You don't need to become a cryptocurrency expert; understanding the basics of privacy and security will suffice.
