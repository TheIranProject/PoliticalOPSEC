# Not Getting Caught > Plausible Deniability

### Prioritize Not Getting Caught

In the context of authoritarian governments, not getting caught is more important than plausible deniability. Once someone suspects you are behind an important anti-government account, they can raid your house and force you to provide passwords for all your accounts, and gaining full access to all your devices. "You have the right to remain silent" applies primarily to democratic countries. Your best chance under an authoritarian government is to not get caught in the first place.

### Focus on Being the Wrong Guy

If you are ever held by authorities, don't even think about saying things like, "You don't have any evidence against me." Instead, your efforts should be directed toward implying, "You've got the wrong guy." Ensure that your devices appear normal at first glance. Always assume that someone might gain access to your devices without you having the time to hide anything. Your focus should be on making everything look ordinary.
