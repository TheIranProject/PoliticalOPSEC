# Managing Passwords

## What?

1. **Use Strong Passwords.**  
   Passwords should be a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, and they should be at least 20 characters long. Avoid trying to create a strong password on your own, and do not establish a pattern for generating new passwords. Having a pattern, such as `MyPetNam!1980`, is a poor practice, and adding a platform name (e.g., `MyPetNam!1980twitter`) does not improve security.

   **Use a Password Generator.**  
   Almost all password managers offer a random password generator. Use these tools and do not attempt to remember these passwords. Learn to become comfortable with using your password manager.

2. **Use an Offline Encrypted Password Manager.**  
   Password managers are an easy and secure way to store your passwords. Avoid using cloud-based password managers as much as possible; instead, prefer offline and encrypted options. KeePass and KeePassXC are among the best options available for all major platforms. They are free and open-source.

3. **Remember Only 1 or 2 Passphrases.**  
   Passphrases are a series of unrelated words that can be used as a password. You should remember only 1 or 2 passphrases for critical accounts, such as your password manager. For example, a random passphrase could be:  
   `motive-best-think-twelve-card`

   Ensure that your passphrase is random. Generate a random passphrase and memorize it. Avoid including personal information. Once you have your random passphrase, mix it with uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters in a way that is easy to remember.  
   **Example:**  
   `m0tive-b3st-th!nk-twElve-card`

   It is challenging to remember several long passphrases, so aim to memorize only 1 or 2 for your password manager or operating system, and use a password manager for the rest of your accounts.

4. **NEVER Reuse Your Passwords/Passphrases.**  
   Each of your accounts should have a unique password. Never use the same password across multiple apps or websites.

5. **Do Not Use Biometric Login (Face, Fingerprint).**  
   Biometric logins can be less secure than traditional passwords, especially in authoritarian contexts.

6. **Always Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on Top of a Password.**  
   You don't need to use your phone number for 2FA; instead, you can use your password manager for this purpose. Search for how to use 2FA with your password manager of choice.

## Why?

1. **Easier Passwords Are Easier to Crack.**  
   Consider the following types of attacks:  
   - [Brute-force attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack)  
   - [Dictionary attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack)  
  
2. **Your Usernames and Passwords Can Be Compromised in Data Breaches.**  
   Using the same login credentials for multiple accounts means that if one of those apps/websites is hacked, your accounts on other apps/websites are also at risk.

3. **You Might Be Forced by Authorities to Open Your Devices Using Biometric Login.**  
   While authorities can also force you to provide passwords, you have options like "self-destruct" or "hidden OS" in case of password failure.

## Additional Suggestions:

1. **Monitor for Data Breaches.**  
   Use services like Have I Been Pwned to check if your email or passwords have been involved in a data breach. If you find that your credentials have been compromised, change your passwords immediately.

### Learn About Phishing Attacks

1. **Recognize Phishing Attempts.**  
   Phishing attacks often come in the form of emails, messages, or websites that appear legitimate but are designed to steal your personal information. Be cautious of unsolicited communications that ask for sensitive information or direct you to unfamiliar websites.

2. **Verify the Source.**  
   Always verify the sender's email address and look for signs of phishing, such as poor grammar, generic greetings, or suspicious links.

### The Use of Security Questions
1. **Create Unique Answers.**  
   If you must use security questions, consider providing answers that are not directly related to the question. For example, if the question is "What is your favorite color?" you could answer with a random word or phrase that you can remember but is not easily guessable.

2. **Store Answers Securely.**  
   If you choose to use unique answers for security questions, store them securely in your password manager. This way, you can access them when needed without compromising your security.
