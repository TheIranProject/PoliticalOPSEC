All contributions are welcome. If you have any suggestions or think that any of the rules is not good advice, feel free to create an Issue or a Pull Request.
If you are not sure that something is good advice, just create an Issue first so it can be discussed before being added to the repository.

Roadmap:
1. Finding and fixing the problems with current rules.
2. Translation to Farsi
3. Adding a new section: "The Common Tactics Used by Governments to Find Dissidents". You can create an issue with your story.
